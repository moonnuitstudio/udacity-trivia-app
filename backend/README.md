# Trivia API | Backend

Udacity, as part of its proposal to create ties between its employees, is looking to develop a web page to manage a question-and-answer game, that is, the creation of a Trivia App.

As students in the Full Stack Developer course, we were tasked with finishing the trivia app using Flask for the backend and React for the front end.

## Getting Started

- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys. 


### Install Dependencies

1. **Python Latest Version** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app.py`and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

```bash
createdb trivia
```

Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file, in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Run the Server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

## Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable 
- 500: Internal Error
